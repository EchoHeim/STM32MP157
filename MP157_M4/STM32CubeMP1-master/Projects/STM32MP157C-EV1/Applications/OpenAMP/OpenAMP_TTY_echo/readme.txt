@par Application Description

How to use OpenAMP MW + Virtual UART to create an Inter-Processor Communication channel seen as TTY device in Linux OS.

This project deals with CPU2 (Cortex-M4) firmware and requires Linux OS running on CPU1 (Cortex-A7)
OpenAMP MW uses the following HW resources
    * IPCC peripheral for event signal (mailbox) between CPU1(CA7) and CPU2(CM4)
    * MCUSRAM peripheral for buffer communications (virtio buffers) between CPU1(CA7) and CPU2(CM4)
            Reserved shared memeory region for this example: SHM_ADDR=0x10040000 and SHM_SIZE=128k.
            It is defined in platform_info.c file

In this example:
    - CPU2(CM4) turns on the LED4. the LED4 is fixed ON until OpenAMP middleware is initialized.
    - CPU2(CM4) initializes OpenAMP MW which initializes/configures IPCC peripheral through HAL
    and setup openamp-rpmsg framwork infrastructure.
    - CPU2(CM4) creates 2 RPMsg channels for 2 virtual UART instance UART0 and UART1
    - CPU2(CM4) is waiting for messages from CPU1(CA7) on these both channels.
    - LED4 toggles when the RPMsg communication is initialised.
    - When CPU2(CM4) receives a message on 1 Virtual UART instance/rpmsg channel,
      it sends the message back to CPU1(CA7) on the same Virtual UART instance.
    - LED4 is turned OFF if any error occurs.

    Notes:
    - It requires Linux console to run example.
    - CM4 logging is redirected in Shared memory in MCUSRAM and can be displayed in Linux console for verdict
      using following command:
          cat /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/trace0

    Following command should be done in Linux console on CA7 to run the example :

    > stty -onlcr -echo -F /dev/ttyRPMSG0
    > cat /dev/ttyRPMSG0 &
    > stty -onlcr -echo -F /dev/ttyRPMSG1
    > cat /dev/ttyRPMSG1 &
    > echo "Hello Virtual UART0" >/dev/ttyRPMSG0
    > echo "Hello Virtual UART1" >/dev/ttyRPMSG1

    You should get "Hello Virtual UART0" and "Hello Virtual UART1" in Linux console

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32MP157CAAx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32MP157C-EV1 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
