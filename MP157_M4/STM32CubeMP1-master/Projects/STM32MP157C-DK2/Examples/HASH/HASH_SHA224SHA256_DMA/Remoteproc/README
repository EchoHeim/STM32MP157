@par Description of M4 Cube example with Linux Remote Processor Framework

When Cube firmware is running on Cortex-M4, System Clock tree and regulators(vrefbuf) are configured by Cortex-A7
Besides, clock source for each peripheral assigned to Cortex-M4 is done by Cortex-A7.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work with Linux running on Cortex-A7, you must do the following :
Before running M4 Cube example, you have to
1) interrupt uboot
2) choose the right configuration to make sure that M4 resources are assigned to Linux Resource Manager driver

Then,
 - Start example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh start" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will load and start firmware using Linux Remote Processor
 - Stop example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh stop" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will stop firmware using Linux Remote Processor

@par Example Description
This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to 
hash data using SHA224 and SHA256 Algorithms.

In this example, DMA is used to transfer data from internal RAM to HASH peripheral.
The SHA224 message digest length is 28 bytes and the SHA256 message digest length 
is 32 bytes.

The expected HASH digests (for SHA224 and SHA256) are already computed using an online
HASH tool. Those values are compared to those computed by the HASH peripheral.
In case of digest computation mismatch or initialization issue the LED7 is blinking (200 ms period).
In case the SHA224 and SHA256 digest are computed correctly the LED7 is turned ON.

The System clock source is configured by the SystemClock_Config() function in case of Engineering Mode, this clock configuration is done
by the Firmware running on the Cortex-A7 in case of Production Mode.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32MP157CACx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with a STM32MP157CACx embedded on an
    STM32MP157C-DK2 board and can be easily tailored to any other supported
    device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
