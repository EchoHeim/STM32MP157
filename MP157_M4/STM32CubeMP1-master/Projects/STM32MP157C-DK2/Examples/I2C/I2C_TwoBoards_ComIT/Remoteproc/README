@par Description of M4 Cube example with Linux Remote Processor Framework

When Cube firmware is running on Cortex-M4, System Clock tree and regulators(vrefbuf) are configured by Cortex-A7
Besides, clock source for each peripheral assigned to Cortex-M4 is done by Cortex-A7.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work with Linux running on Cortex-A7, you must do the following :
Before running M4 Cube example, you have to
1) interrupt uboot
2) choose the right configuration to make sure that M4 resources are assigned to Linux Resource Manager driver

Then,
 - Start example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh start" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will load and start firmware using Linux Remote Processor
 - Stop example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh stop" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will stop firmware using Linux Remote Processor

@par Example Description
How to handle I2C data buffer transmission/reception between two boards, 
using an interrupt.

Board: STM32MP157C-DK2 (embeds a STM32MP15xx device)
SCL Pin: PA11 (CN13, D15)
SDA Pin: PA12 (CN13, D14)

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the systick.
Then the System clock source is configured by the SystemClock_Config() function in case of Engineering Mode, this clock configuration is done
by the Firmware running on the Cortex-A7 in case of Production Mode.

The I2C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I2C_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_I2C_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed I2C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO and NVIC). You may update this function to change I2C configuration.

The I2C communication is then initiated.
The project is split in two parts: the Master Board and the Slave Board
- Master Board
  The HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_IT() and the HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT() functions 
  allow respectively the reception and the transmission of a predefined data buffer
  in Master mode using interrupt.
- Slave Board
  The HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_IT() and the HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_IT() functions 
  allow respectively the reception and the transmission of a predefined data buffer
  in Slave mode using interrupt.
The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define MASTER_BOARD"
in the "main.c" file:
If the Master board is used, the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be uncommented.
If the Slave board is used the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be commented.

For this example the aTxBuffer is predefined and the aRxBuffer size is same as aTxBuffer.

In a first step after the user press the USER1 push-button on the Master Board,
I2C Master starts the communication by sending aTxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT()
to I2C Slave which receives aRxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_IT(). 
The second step starts when the user press the USER1 push-button on the Master Board,
the I2C Slave sends aTxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_IT()
to the I2C Master which receives aRxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_IT().
The end of this two steps are monitored through the HAL_I2C_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aTxBuffer and aRxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

STM32MP157C-DK2's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED7 is ON when the transmission process is complete.
 - LED7 is OFF when the reception process is complete.
 - LED7 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period) in case of error in initialization or 
transmission/reception process

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

    - Connect I2C_SDA line of Master board (PA12, CN13, D14) to I2C_SDA line of Slave Board (PA12, CN13, D14).
    - Connect GND of Master board to GND of Slave Board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
    o Uncomment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Comment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
