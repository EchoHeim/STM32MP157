* STMicroelectronics STM32 SDMMC2 controller

The highspeed MMC host controller on STM32 soc family
provides an interface for MMC, SD and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmci.txt and the properties used by the sdmmc2 driver.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be one of:
   "st,stm32-sdmmc2"

Example:
	sdmmc1: sdmmc@0x58005000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-sdmmc2";
		reg = <0x58005000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&rcc SDMMC1_K>;
		resets = <&rcc SDMMC1_R>;
		cap-sd-highspeed;
		cap-mmc-highspeed;
		status = "disabled";
	};
