STMicroelectronics STM32 Factory-programmed data device tree bindings

This represents STM32 Factory-programmed read only non-volatile area: locked
flash, OTP, read-only HW regs... This contains various information such as:
analog calibration data for temperature sensor (e.g. TS_CAL1, TS_CAL2),
internal vref (VREFIN_CAL), unique device ID...

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of:
			"st,stm32-romem"
			"st,stm32mp15-bsec"
- reg:			Offset and length of factory-programmed area.
- #address-cells:	Should be '<1>'.
- #size-cells:		Should be '<1>'.

Optional Data cells:
- Must be child nodes as described in nvmem.txt.

Optional-properties:
- "st,non-secure-otp" specifies that the OTP can be accessed by non-secure
  world through secure world services. Only useful for upper OTPs. This
  property mandates 32-bit granularity of the related nvmem area, that is
  offset and length are both multiple of 4.

Example on stm32f4:
	romem: nvmem@1fff7800 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-romem";
		reg = <0x1fff7800 0x400>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		/* Data cells: ts_cal1 at 0x1fff7a2c */
		ts_cal1: calib@22c {
			reg = <0x22c 0x2>;
		};
		...
	};

Example on stm32mp1:
	bsec: nvmem@5c005000 {
		...
		mac_addr: mac_addr@e4 {
			reg = <0xe4 0x8>;
			st,non-secure-otp;
		};
		...
	};

The nvmem_layout node gathers all nvmem platform-dependent layout information,
including OTP names and phandles, in order to allow easy accesses for data
consumers, using pre-defined string in nvmem-cell-names property.

Required properties:
- compatible:		"st,stm32-nvmem-layout"
- nvmem-cells and nvmem-cell-names, as described in nvmem.txt.

Example on stm32mp1:
	nvmem_layout: nvmem_layout@0 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-nvmem-layout";
		nvmem-cells = <&part_number_otp>,
			      ...
			      ;
		nvmem-cell-names = "part_number_otp",
				   ...
				   ;
	};

	bsec: nvmem@5c005000 {
		...
		part_number_otp: part_number_otp@4 {
			reg = <0x4 0x1>;
		};
		...
	};
