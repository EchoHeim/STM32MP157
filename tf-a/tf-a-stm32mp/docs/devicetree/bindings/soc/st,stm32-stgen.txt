STMicroelectronics STM32 STGEN
===============================

The STM32 System Generic Counter generate a time count value. This
is a 64 bits wide counter.

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "st,stm32-stgen"
- reg : Should be register base and length as documented in the datasheet

Example:

	stgen: stgen@5C008000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-stgen";
		reg = <0x5C008000 0x1000>;
		status = "okay";
	};
